ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to use a fragmented images of text/image/picture
in captcha. The feature is called Jigsaw Captcha.

PURPOSE:
========
A broken up image of text/image/picture is nearly 
impossible to crack/hack using character recognition 
software, and would definitely require human intervention.

Also this would cause the end-user to take time to 
recognise the word itself further reducing the 
extent of hacking of websites by human beings as well. 

DESCRIPTION:
============
An image of text (number, alphanumeric, special characters, 
localized language text) or an Image/picture that is generally 
used by the website to identify if the end user is indeed a 
human (feature commonly known as 'captcha') if sent as a 
non-intersecting fragments of images (like a jigsaw 
puzzle), will further thwart the use of character recognition 
programs.  

The fragments of the captcha image itself may be displayed 
as a single image or it can be displayed as individual 
images itself.

A human end-user will be able recognise the text/image/picture 
as a whole even though it may be broken up into several 
(greater than or equivalent to two fragments) fragments 
of images .

Optionally the user may be provided with an applet or a 
flash program to try and join the pieces in order for the
user to identify the captcha image itself.
