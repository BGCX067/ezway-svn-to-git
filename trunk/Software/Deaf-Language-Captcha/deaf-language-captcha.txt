ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to use deaf language hand symbols to for 
the captcha (challenge-response) images.

PURPOSE:
========
The use of deaf language hand symbols to identify
if the user is a human or software robot trying
to access the website. The deaf language
makes it hard for the software program to identify
the symbols hence the input in most cases has to 
be human. As it requires a reference image for 
a human being to identify the set of characters.
Reason being the deaf language is not known to over
90% of the human language.
