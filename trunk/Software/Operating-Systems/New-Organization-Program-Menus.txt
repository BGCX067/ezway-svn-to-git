Abstract:
========

The usual design of all the operating system menu layout is done in 
such a way that it represents the age old DOS approach of showing
options under "File", "Edit" and "Help". Which is the most common
options for a particular GUI (Graphical User Interface) Programs
in Production even as of today. This layout hasn't 
changed ever since its inception in DOS (Disk Operating System)
created by Microsoft and implemented by all other Operating systems 
as of today, irrespective of it being proprietory or not.

This document proposes a new layout of the Menu that alters the 
layout in such a way that it holds meaning in the modern day. 
And isn't confusing to the end user at all.  As the menu option
"File" is a method to group the operations on the file(s) the 
program is associated with.
The menu may or may not contain "File", "Edit" and "Help". However
it will always start with "Cmd" or "Command" or "Options" or 
"Program" or "Operation" or something similar (pertaining to the 
program related operations rather than the files the program
is meant to "operate" on, the latter behaviour is existent as of today 
in most software products created or maintained by Microsoft 
Inc and other Software Companies/Technology-related Institutions
/Corporations/MNCs).

Depending on the Users language set on the "Operating System", 
"Start" of the menu could be either "Left" or "Right" or "Top" 
or "Bottom" of the menu itself. Example: Arabic/Hebrew is a language
that is written from Right to left. Here "Start of the Menu" is
"Right". In English, its usually "Left" unless and until user
modified the configuration of the "GUI" software.


TERMINOLOGY USED:
=================

"Program" or "Application" or "Executable" in this document 
refers to a Software irrespective of its state of execution. Doesn't
necessarily have to posses a GUI. However in the abstract mentioned
above it talks specifically about "Programs" with "GUI".

"DOS" or Disk Operating System is a Non-GUI Operating System Developed
by Microsoft Inc.

"GUI" refers to Graphical User Interface. A "GUI" Program is a program
that provides a Visual mechanism to use the program with the aid of
computer peripherals such as keyboards, mouses, tablets, other pointing
devices, monitors...etc". It is generally provided as a part of the 
Operating System and generally provided by a "Library". It provides 
users with a visual mechanism of using a "Program". However individual
program may or may not be supplied with its own set of "Libraries".

"Operating System" refers to the word used in the field of 
Computing/Software.

A file is document text or binary stored on a computer storage device, 
it may or may not an "Executable" or "Program" or "Application".

A file operation may or may not necessarily cause change to the file
itself.

A menu is a visual grouping mechanism for related operations or 
in some cases unrelated operations that may or may not be seperated 
by a "seperator" in a GUI "Program", provided by a "GUI" Library.
Example: "File" in its most common usage in all GUI "Program" 
refers to the set of operations the program provides for file(s) 
associated with itself. It may or may not contain all the 
operations pertaining to the file(s) itself.

A "Library" is a group(in a file) of commonly used Software routines 
or functions. It can also refer to "Program" that provides services
to other "Program".

All other terminology used but not explicitly defined in this
document, relates to the field of Software, Software Development,
Computer Science and its associated Fields.

Microsoft Inc Refers to the Company and Shareholders of
Microsoft Inc, Silicon Valley, Mountain View, CA-94043, USA.
They are the creators/maintainers of Microsoft Windows Operating
System, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio Application, 
apart from many such programs/application.
