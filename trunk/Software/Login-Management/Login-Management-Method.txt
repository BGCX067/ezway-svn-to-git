Abstract:
=========
A method to consolidate user login/registration service on a 
seperate website in order to prevent wastage of time/money
/effort to an internet-company/company that offers service 
via the internet and to make the life of an end-user a lot 
more simpler as he/she now only has to remember
a single login-password pair to access multiple services.

Purpose:
========
A consolidated approach to maintaining user login/registration 
service on a single website also allows the company/individual
offering services via the internet to manage lesser program code
that would otherwise cost a lot more time/effor/money in order
to create and maintain the same. 

Most websites that are internet based/offer services via internet
expects the user to register and login before the services
provided by the former can be accessed. This means users  
user is expected to remember multiple set of username-password 
pairs in order to access services provided by the website, 
which after a point of time becomes tedious and unmanagable.

So, A consolidated approach works in the favor of both the 
end-user as well as companies/individuals providing service
over the internet.
