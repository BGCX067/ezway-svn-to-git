ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to use refernce image that associates images
to characters present on the computer keyboard for
a captcha Image test on a website. 

PURPOSE:
========
The use of a refernce image that is associated with 
characters present on a keyboard to test if a 
particular user accessing a website is indeed human 
or not. This allows the website some control over the
otherwise weak character recognition captcha test 
images that can be easily cracked using character 
recognition software. 

DESCRIPTION:
============
Here, the character 'A' could be associated to an image
and character 'B' is associated to another image not 
necessarily related. It could be associated with an image
of a character itself. The website must also provide 
a refernce image that displays the images associated with
characters present on keyboard.

EXAMPLE:
========
Website shows the reference image containing set of
Images with character associations and the captcha image
An example of a refernce image could be, 
'Image of car' = A, 'Image of skull' = B , 'Image of 
letter Z' = C, 'Image of the deaf language symbol 
for E' = D ... etc.

If Captcha Image displays 'Image of car' and 'Image of 
letter Z'. The reponse from the user of the website 
must be 'AB' in order for the website to carry out 
the operation requested.
