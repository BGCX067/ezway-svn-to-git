ABSTRACT:
=========
This document talks of a method to improve the experience of web based e-mail 
usage and access.

A visual/audible alarm/intimation/alert provided to the user of the web-email
service for a reply received on an e-mail that was sent by the user which would 
otherwise be filtered from the inbox into a specific folder present on 
his/her web-email service based on the filter conditions that was set. 


PURPOSE:
========
Web based email service providers generally provide a feature called folders. 
The normal practice of using the folder is w.r.t the filtering of the mails 
based on the subject, sender, content...etc apart from the other similar 
criteria. 
The mail that comes in to the inbox is sorted based on the filter condition 
provided by the user of the web email service and it normally bypasses the 
web email inbox altogether. If we get an email that would be sent to a folder
based on the set conditions by the user. There is a possibility that the user
may miss the mail altogther. Hence this feature that alerts the user based on
a visual/audible intimation/alert/alarm to tell the user that he/she has indeed
received a reply to an email that was sent. This alarm is not displayed for all 
the e-mails that arrives but its shown/played only when the user receives a 
reply for a email he/she sends that would be otherwise filtered from the inbox 
into a folder based on the filter conditions set by the user of the web-email
service.
