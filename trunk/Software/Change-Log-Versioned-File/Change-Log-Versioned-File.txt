ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to maintain a stand alone versioned file that 
maintains a record of all the changes done to that 
particular file.

PURPOSE:
========
A single/multi user versioning system that allows the 
user to maintain a record of all the changes done to 
the particular file done over a period of time. The 
record of changes are maintained like a change log 
of events, based on a userid, line number, version 
number and time of the change.

DESCRIPTION:
============
The change log could be maintained as a readable text
file or can be stored in a database. Multiple users 
will be able to access modify create different versions
of the same file. The original file doesn't exist
in this versioning file but instead only the changelog 
file exists. It is from the change log file the 
original file is derived.
