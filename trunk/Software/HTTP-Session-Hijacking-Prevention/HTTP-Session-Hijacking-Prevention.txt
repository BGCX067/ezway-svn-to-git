ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to prevent HTTP session Hijacking by using a time dependent
random series of algorithms that alters password/hash-response/
challenge-response before allowing the user to login to a 
particular website.

PURPOSE:
========
1. To prevent bot programs from accessing the website.
2. To prevent a hacker from using the same password/hash/response.

DESCRIPTION:
============
A script is used to generate the alterations in the algorithm like 
replacing binary XOR with a binary OR (likewise). The script makes these
alterations based on time and a random number combination or possible
some other similar methods. 

The scripts used must alter the algorithm and it must create
server-side software code and the client-side software 
code. The software code has to be generated so as to prevent any 
chances of replication. This will ensure that the only problem that
ever exists. 


NOTE:
=====
1. The calculation on the server side and the client side should 
yield the same result.
2. The algorithms have to be created, as in each algorithm is 
different from the other.
