ABSTRACT:
=========
This document describes a method to deliver software to 
the end users.

DESCRIPTION:
============
The delivery of the software is done via a another "software"
that will from now on be termed as the "fetcher", and the
"software" that is delivered from here on will be termed
as the "fetched".

Description of "fetcher":
-------------------------
The "fetcher" is a support tool that aids in the software
delivery mechanism itself. It may or may be optionally 
coupled with an online service that aids in the below 
mentioned tasks.

The "fetcher" performs the following tasks:
-------------------------------------------
1. It discovers the repository from where the "fetched"
can be downloaded. It can also discover the "fetched" on
the same system (system on which the "fetcher" resides),
on a LAN, or on a WAN or on the internet. The location
of the fetched can be manually programmed into the
"fetcher".

2. The "fetcher" also supports an "unlimited" (limited
only by computer resources) number of software
repositories. This can be manually configured or
automatically configured by configuration file that may
be read from the same system (system on which the
"fetcher" resides), or downloaded and read from a LAN,
or a WAN or from the Internet.

3. Once the "fetched" is located and downloaded, the
"fetcher" performs the installation of the fetched.
The "fetcher" then optionally (configured by the vendor
of the fetched) performs encryption (using a randomly
generated key) and/or compression of the "fetched"
and then stores the files at the user chosen location
on the computer system,
the encryption key will not be stored locally but at
an online "fetcher" key storing service. To which anyone
may be registered to for a fee (or advertisements) or
gratis.

4. "Fetcher" starts the program by providing an emulated
environment where in the files are decompressed and
unencrypted(to prevent tampering of the fetched) where
ever necessary.

5. The "fetcher" then starts the executable program or
application associated with the "fetched".
