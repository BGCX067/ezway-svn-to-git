ABSTRACT:
=========
Method to perform the captcha feature on a website
by getting the user to match figures in two sets of
images or a set of images with a set of words in 
text format.

PURPOSE:
========
This enables the website to prevent any use of 
character recognition algorithm to defeat character 
recognition programs. 

DESCRIPTION:
============
By getting the user to match the figures, the user
is required to match two images that are either same
, altered sightly (ex: color and monochrome or image
and its rotated version) or images that may convey
the same/similar purpose  (ex: car and aeroplane, 
being means of transportation) or arbitary images 
that can be grouped together (ex: sun and a star can 
grouped together as they are both stars, earth and 
saturn being can be grouped together as both are 
planets. Similarly, dog and cat as both as both are 
mammals).

In the case of the Image to text matching or text to
image matching, the text and the image as mentioned 
above could be related. (Example: a picture of a car
could be matched to one of the words travel, 
transportation, vehicle, car etc...)

The sets itself doesn't have to be of the same length
the 'match from' or the first set however has to be 
smaller in size in comparison to 'match to' set or 
the second set.

Images themselves may be altered using an algorithm
to prevent image recognition programs from being used
to identify the image from a given set of images.
