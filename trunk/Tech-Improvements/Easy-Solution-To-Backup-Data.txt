Purpose:
--------
1. To Backup Data, Contacts, Information During charging of a communication,
computer/mobile device(such as Mobile phones/PDAS/Laptops/Netbooks/E-BookReaders
/presentation device(sixth sense...etc)/music player/digital camera ...etc 
Some of these are communication devices.)
2. To prevent user from having to manually back up the information on a 
periodical basis.


Problem:
--------
In case of theft or loss of a communication/computer/mobile device there is a chance 
that people could to lose their data which in my opinion is very valuable/important 
to its owner. A timely backup of the data is great solution unless you lose that device 
as well (this is however a rare phenomenon), a greater possibility is that we forget 
all about a timely periodical backup as we are indeed human beings (and to err is...).


Solution:
---------
Mobile charger includes a Flash memory (a card type is preferable) that can be removable, 
while connecting the device for charging, the data, contacts and other information from 
the communication/computer/mobile device could be transferred to the charging device and 
the charging device just writes this backup data onto the flash memory. A computer may
 require a backup memory between 32GB-128gb, For a mobile/communication device it can be 
much smaller around 2GB-32GB.

This will likely increase the need for people to buy new and more improved computer/
communication/mobile device with a charger with data backup ability.
